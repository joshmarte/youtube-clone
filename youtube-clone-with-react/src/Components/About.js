                My background prior to Pursuit is in customer service and office administration, where I have proven myself to be a loyal and contentious employee at several top tier organizations. It was during this time, that I refined my communication skills, mastering the ability communicate clearly and concisely. As well as proving myself to be able to navigate and communicate diplomatically across various levels of an organization.

                I am grateful for my opportunity at Pursuit as it allows me the opportunity to gain the skills necessary to bring my customer service experience to the fast-growing tech field and hopefully become a champion for diversity in the industry. My goal is be able to build impactful and beautiful client interfaces that convert customers into clients.

                In my spare time, you can find me playing my oboe, and exploring the sights of New York City.

              I have been teaching for five years now and am ready to take the skills that I have learned in Education to a new career in Technology. As a teacher I have learned the art of patience, the need to be flexible and the importance of creativity. My students make up such a large portion of my world that it is hard to imagine a world that doesn’t include them—I am embarking on this new journey so that I can show them that there are other career options available and the path most taken isn’t the only path.
