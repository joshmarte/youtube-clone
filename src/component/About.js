              Hello, I go by Josh. I am an experienced professional with a
              diverse background in project management and business
              intelligence. I am currently working to further develop my

              I have been teaching for five years now and am ready to take the
              skills that I have learned in Education to a new career in
              Technology. As a teacher I have learned the art of patience, the
              need to be flexible and the importance of creativity. My students
              make up such a large portion of my world that it is hard to
              imagine a world that doesn’t include them—I am embarking on this
              new journey so that I can show them that there are other career
              options available and the path most taken isn’t the only path.
